    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The foundation of computational simulation credibility is an evidence package that encompasses requirements definition, assessment of code capabilities to model the desired physics, computational and SME judgment elements demonstrating why the results can be trusted for the intended use and communicating gaps. The Eclipse based Next Generation Workflow (NGW) has been developed to graphically author, communicate and reliably execute analysis as well as ensemble workflows over a heterogenous set of computing platforms. The Credibility Framework (CF) provides a platform to execute, collect and communicate credibility evidence integrates with NGW.  CF provides is configurable by non-programmers through simple Excel spreadsheets to enable tailoring the credibility process to meet the needs of the analysis provider organizations, customers and regulatory agencies.  An end-to-end use case is demonstrated through a realistic solid mechanics exemplar with ensemble studies supporting computational aspects of credibility such as solution verification with respect to various numerical factors as well as sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speech-title">Talk 01: The Themis Ensemble Generation Tool</h3>
    <h3 class="speakers-name">David Domyancic</h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We present a new ensemble of simulations generator named Themis.  Themis leverages a simulation submission batch script to create an ensemble with minimal setup time.  Themis can be used to generate simple parameter studies, which can be scaled to million member studies, or to generate complex design optimization workflows or machine learning workflows such that users can create dynamic and adaptive optimization loops using straightforward Python scripting.  Themis has an easy-to-use command line interface for fast study generation, and a Python API for building complex workflows.
We will demonstrate how to evolve a batch submission script, which runs a single simulation, to a study using the Themis command line interface.  Themis’ CLI allows users to: generate studies, dry-run studies, report study status, kill/restart of individual simulations, and harvest simulation outputs.
We will also show how Themis&rsquo;s Python API can be used to build a dynamic optimization workflow incorporating simulation, post-processing, and Scikit Learn.
Our new capability is free-standing, with a Python interface, allowing it to be incorporated into existing tools and workflows.  We will present our path forward to supporting massive ensembles on the El Capitan system to be sited in 2022 by discussing the results of scaling to a million member ensemble and our ongoing collaboration with FLUX, the next generation scheduler team in Livermore Computing.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Workflows are a key technology for enabling complex scientific computations. They capture the interdependencies between data processing tasks as well as the mechanisms to execute those steps reliably and efficiently. Workflows can capture complex processes to promote sharing and reuse, and also provide provenance information necessary for the verification of scientific results and for scientific reproducibility. Pegasus (<a href="https://pegasus.isi.edu">https://pegasus.isi.edu</a>) is being used in production in a number of scientific domains. In 2016 the LIGO gravitational wave experiment used Pegasus to analyze instrumental data and confirm the first detection of a gravitational wave. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) based at USC, uses a Pegasus managed workflow infrastructure called Cybershake to generate seismic hazard maps for the entire state of  California. In March 2017, SCEC conducted a large-scale CyberShake study on DOE systems, ORNL’s Titan and NCSA’s BlueWaters, managing over 39 thousands jobs and 1.2 PB of data. Pegasus is also being used in astronomy, bioinformatics, civil engineering, climate modeling, earthquake science, molecular dynamics and other complex analyses.
In this presentation we will provide a brief overview of Pegasus and we are going to focus on how we can use Pegasus to execute on current OLCF resources by creating a workflow execution environment as a service using Kubernetes, and launching jobs on Summit and Rhea at OLCF.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speakers-name">Patricia Grubel</h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We present the capabilities of BEE, a workflow engine to execute
and manage scientific multi-step simulations over a range of
platforms including High Performance Computing and Cloud
systems. The open standard Common Workflow Language for workflow
descriptions is adopted by BEE.  The workflow engine consists of
modular component servers that communicate through a RESTFul API
for running on a single computer or across the internet. Neo4j
graph database is used to manage and store workflows. BEE
manages workflow tasks to run through common resource managers
of HPC systems such as Slurm, LSF, or PBS and manage cloud
resources such as private OpenStack clouds. BEE supports running
scientific simulations and the associated tasks of the workflow
in containers by supporting container runtime systems such as
Charliecloud, Singularity, and Podman.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speech-title">Talk 05: funcX: a federated function serving fabric for workflows</h3>
    <h3 class="speakers-name">Kyle Chard</h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Exploding data volumes and velocities, new computational methods and platforms, and ubiquitous connectivity demand new approaches to computation in the sciences. These new approaches must enable computation to be mobile, so that, for example, it can occur near data, be triggered by events (e.g., arrival of new data), be offloaded to specialized accelerators, or run remotely where resources are available. They also require new design approaches in which monolithic applications can be decomposed into smaller components, that may in turn be executed separately and on the most suitable resources. To address these needs we present funcX&mdash;a distributed function as a service (FaaS) platform that enables flexible, scalable, and high performance remote function execution. funcX&rsquo;s endpoint software can transform existing clouds, clusters, and supercomputers into function serving systems, while funcX&rsquo;s cloud-hosted service provides transparent, secure, and reliable function execution across a federated ecosystem of endpoints. We motivate the need for funcX with several scientific case studies, present our prototype design and implementation, show optimizations that deliver throughput in excess of 1 million functions per second, and demonstrate, via experiments on two supercomputers, that funcX can scale to more than more than 130000 concurrent workers.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our team has built Sina to bring sub-second, many-million-run-scale querying to an environment that has traditionally spawned many user-authored one-off solutions. We’re working to fold database technologies (SQLite, MySQL, Cassandra) into this environment with minimal disruption to users by unifying different backends behind a single, simple Python API. But we’re looking forward to another goal as well: unifying the outputs of many scientific simulations under a single file schema. We’ll be presenting on Sina’s capabilities, some successes and challenges, the delights of performant large-scale querying for large-scale data, and what interested groups can do to help move their own environments towards a more HPC- and user-time-friendly future.</p></p>

    <h3 class="speakers-name">Michael Oland</h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-company"></h3>

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Implementing business and technical processes requires coordination between technical implementation teams, business representatives and stakeholders. There have been a number of approaches proposed and described that attempt to simplify the process by either providing technical implementation details or by applying a form of functional decomposition to derive the steps. While useful, these approaches fail to adequately convey the fundamentals of the processes they are describing. This paper describes a novel approach to achieve this goal through three key criteria: initiating event, the goal, and the desired outcome, resulting in a new method of describing processes.</p></p>
